**Prospective Students**    
I am always interested in hearing from prospective students who are interested in joining the research group. I encourage women, queer, indigenous, and other minority group scholars to get in touch. I support flexible working hours and locations.     

[Contact me](#contact) for information.   

**Current Opportunities**   

I have no projects available at present. However, I am always happy to discuss potential collaborations with students. If you have something you're interested in and think we'd work well together, please do get in touch.
