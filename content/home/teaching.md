As a teacher I aim to provide my students with skills, knowledge and confidence critical to their academic and personal development. I take an inclusive approach, developing strong relationships and encouraging discussion.  I work to support my students in all aspects while respecting their individuality and independence.

GE1S008 - Observational Fieldwork  
Field-focussed, this module teaches fundamental ecological skills, including observational, surveying and recording techniques, species identification and behavioural observations.   


GE2S008 - Biodiversity and Biogeography   
Explores fundamental ideas in biogeography, including the global distribution or organisms in the past and present, and their relationships with physical environments.


GE2S017 - Research Methods in Natural History    
This module aims to develop subject-specific skills through the use of meaningful examples in experimental tasks, underpinned with theoretical content, including subjects such as behavioural sciences, genetics, ecological principles and field biology. 


GE3S009 - Mediterranean Field Expedition   
Field-focussed and centred on instrumental measurement, fieldwork surveys and analysis of material and data collected from areas within the Mediterranean biome.


ES4S011 - European Field Expedition    
Field-focussed and centred on field skills relevant to the study of terrestrial tetrapods, large mammals in particular.
