My research focuses on increasing our understanding of the various aspects of species-specific and community ecology. 

I use field studies, remote-sensing and contemporary and historical data, along with R code and GIS software, to answer robust questions related to species distributions, community ecology, habitat selection, and anthropogenic impacts. My work has implications for and informs conservation and management processes, policy, and commercial enterprises. 

I am the Editor of the journal Milvus:the Journal of the Welsh Ornithological Society, and Associate Editor of the journal Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation. I am also a member of the BES Welsh Policy Group, Gylfinir Cymru, CIEEM, and USW's Athena SWAN committee.
