abstract: "Carnivores typically exhibit cryptic behavior, which makes it difficult to study the ecology of species in this group. Camera trap bycatch can be a valuable source of important opportunistic records. In this short communication, we present rare records of carnivores in southern Brazil. The first record was of a tayra (Mustelidae) with anomalous coloration known as leucism. Other records were of a possible attempted predation event by two free-ranging dogs on lowland tapir (Perissodactyla, Tapiridae), athreatened species. Our remaining notable records consisted of intra and interspecific interactions of endangered felids (puma, ocelot and southern tiger cat)."
