I am a Lecturer in Conservation Biology and course leader for BSc (Hons) International Wildlife Biology at the [The University of South Wales](https://www.southwales.ac.uk/). My work is broadly focussed on conducting research that increases our understanding of species ecologies and informs conservation and management processes.

I'm always open to new collaborations and speaking to prospective students. If there's anything you'd like to discuss, please [get in touch](#contact).
