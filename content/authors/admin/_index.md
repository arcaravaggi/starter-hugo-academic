I am a Lecturer in Conservation Biology and ecologist at the [The University of South Wales](https://www.southwales.ac.uk/). My work is broadly focussed on conducting research that increases our understanding of species ecologies and informs conservation and management processes. I am interested in applying new technologies to conservation questions, and connecting people with science and nature.   

I'm always open to new collaborations and speaking to prospective students. If there's anything you'd like to discuss, please [get in touch](#contact).

I am the creator and organiser of the twitter-based science communication project, [@Biotweeps](https://twitter.com/biotweeps) and Associate Editor of the journal [*Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation*](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20563485).
